The commit log LIES!  This gem was originally published to RubyForge 5/23/2007.  It was my first library.  Aw..... how cute!

Migrated to github due to popular request.

As of now, the test suite is *not* running cleanly!  You have been warned!

README for rb-skypemac
======================

* 0.3.0
Adds support for:
** Conference calling
** Checking for incoming calls
** Answering incoming calls

* 0.2.0
** Include support for calling, managing calls, and managing users.  Most invocations are made via the Skype class which abstracts much of the Skype API, delegating calls to the constituent objects in the official Skype API.
